At present at least, all militarily establishedcivilisation still stands high above all so-called industrialcivilisation; the latter, in its present form, is in general the meanestmode of existence that has ever been. It is simply the law of necessitythat operates here: people want to live, and have to sell themselves;but they despise him who exploits their necessity, and _purchases_ theworkman. It is curious that the subjection to powerful, fear-inspiring,and even dreadful individuals, to tyrants and leaders of armies, is notat all felt so painfully as the subjection to such undistinguished anduninteresting persons as the captains of industry; in the employer theworkman usually sees merely a crafty, blood-sucking dog of a man,speculating on every necessity, whose name, form, character, andreputation are altogether indifferent to him. It is probable that themanufacturers and great magnates of commerce have hitherto lacked toomuch all those forms and attributes of a _superior race_, which alonemake persons interesting; if they had had the nobility of the nobly-bornin their looks and bearing, there would perhaps have been no socialismin the masses of the people. For these are really ready for _slavery_ ofevery kind, provided that the superior class above them constantly showsitself legitimately superior, and _born_ to command\\u2014by its noblepresence! The commonest man feels that nobility is not to be improvised,and that it is his part to honour it as the fruit of protractedrace-culture,\\u2014but the absence of superior presence, and the notoriousvulgarity of manufacturers with red, fat hands, brings up the thought tohim that it is only chance and fortune that has here elevated the oneabove the other; well then\\u2014so he reasons with himself\\u2014let _us_ in ourturn tempt chance and fortune!

Itis in Doric art that this majestically-rejecting attitude of Apolloperpetuated itself. This opposition became more precarious and evenimpossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the Hellenic nature,similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves:the Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was nowcontented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of hispowerful antagonist. This reconciliation marks the most importantmoment in the history of the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyeswe may observe the revolutions resulting from this event. It wasthe reconciliation of two antagonists, with the sharp demarcationof the boundary-lines to be thenceforth observed by each, and withperiodical transmission of testimonials;--in reality, the chasm wasnot bridged over.

Itis in Doric art that this majestically-rejecting attitude of Apolloperpetuated itself. This opposition became more precarious and evenimpossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the Hellenic nature,similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves:the Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was nowcontented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of hispowerful antagonist. This reconciliation marks the most importantmoment in the history of the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyeswe may observe the revolutions resulting from this event.

That old form ofthinking, however, was thought within the bounds of morality, and for itnothing existed but fixed judgments and established facts, and it had noreasons but those of authority.
